# Tip: Enhance Cursor's Coding by Encouraging Questions

When using Cursor for coding, one effective way to improve the quality of the generated code is to encourage it to ask questions. Here’s how this approach works:

## The Problem with Vague Prompts

Many users have noticed that Cursor tends to prefer generating code, even when the prompts are unclear. For example, if you give a vague prompt like "code stuff," Cursor may produce random and often nonsensical code across different files. Instead of admitting it doesn’t understand, it tries to fill in the gaps with whatever it can generate.

## The Solution: Encourage Questions

To improve the situation, you can add a simple rule to your prompts or include it in your `.cursorrules` file:

**End every prompt with:**  
"Ask me any questions if it makes your instructions clearer."

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Relevant Questions**: By encouraging Cursor to ask questions, you will receive thoughtful and relevant inquiries that help clarify your instructions.
  
2. **Identify Missing Details**: Sometimes, Cursor will point out important details that you may have overlooked in your original request. This can help you refine your requirements.

3. **Improved Code Quality**: By answering the questions posed by Cursor, you can significantly enhance the quality of the generated code. The resulting code will be more aligned with your actual needs.

## Conclusion

Encouraging Cursor to ask questions can lead to better coding outcomes. Instead of generating random code based on vague prompts, you can guide it to understand your requirements more clearly. This simple adjustment can make a big difference in the quality of the code you receive.
