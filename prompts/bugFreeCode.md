# Improving AI-Driven Development with Simple Prompts

When working with AI to write code, using the right prompts can make a big difference. One effective method is to use these two simple lines in every feature request to Cursor:

> **Give a brief overview of what you will do.**
> **Do not write any code until I say to go ahead!**

## Why This Method Works

### 1. **Catching Mistakes**
Asking for an overview before any code is written helps catch mistakes the AI might make. This way, you can fix any misunderstandings before the AI starts generating code.

### 2. **Checking AI Understanding**
This prompt helps you see if the AI really understands what you want. If the overview misses important files or details, you can explain those before moving on.

### 3. **Finding Missing Information**
The overview can show you if the AI is missing any important context. This gives you a chance to add more information so the AI knows exactly what to do.

### 4. **Improving Your Own Understanding**
This process not only helps clarify the AI's understanding but also helps you think more clearly about what you want. By explaining your requirements, you can make sure your own ideas are clear and correct.

## The Process

1. **Describe the Feature to the AI**: Clearly explain what you want to create.
2. **Ask for an Overview**: Request the AI to give a brief overview of how it plans to do it.
3. **Look for Mistakes or Missing Details**: Check the overview for any errors or missing information.
4. **Refine Your Requirements**: Make any necessary changes to your explanation based on the AI's response.
5. **Let It Generate Code**: Once you are happy with the overview and details, tell the AI to start writing the code.

## Conclusion

AI can write code very quickly, but that speed doesn’t matter if the code doesn’t solve the right problem. Using the "overview first" method can save you a lot of time by making sure the code does what you want. By following this approach, you can work better with AI and make your development process smoother.
