1. **Create a `Project_milestones.md` file** and reference it in the `.cursorrules` file. This file should outline the scope of the project with detailed requirements. Cursor can help generate a project file based on this information. At the end of each session, or during the work, it is advisable to ask Cursor to update the file with completed milestones and learnings. 
Below is a sample structure for the milestones.

   ### Phase 1: Manual Operations & Testing
   - Integrate basic API functionalities
   - Set up the database schema
   - Integrate OpenAI functionalities
   - Create a manual data collection script
   - Develop a manual analysis trigger
   - Build a manual review interface
   - Conduct testing and refinement

   ### Learnings & Architecture Decisions

   **Worker Architecture**

   - **Current Setup**: A single worker is handling both API calls.
   - **Recommendation**: Split into separate workers for improved:
     - Rate limiting
     - Error handling
     - Cost tracking
     - Scalability

   **Next Steps**
   - Split workers into:
     - `call-worker`: Responsible for API and data collection
     - `analysis-worker`: Handles OpenAI integration and analysis
     - `api-worker`: Manages admin dashboard endpoints

2. **Create a `Documentation.md` file** and reference it in the `.cursorrules` file. This document should be updated regularly with new functions, schemas, and other relevant information.

3. Visit the [Awesome Cursor Rules GitHub](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules) repository to select the rules that apply to your project stack.

4. In the `.cursorrules` file, ensure to include the following:

   **Project Management:**
   - Reference `PROJECT.md` for all feature implementations.
   - Reference `Documentation.md` for all API endpoints and their request/response formats.
   - Ensure that new code aligns with the defined milestones.
   - Follow the established database schema.
   - Consider cost optimizations as defined in metrics.
   - Maintain consistency with existing components.

5. Regularly **reindex the codebase** by navigating to `Settings -> Cursor settings -> Features`. As the codebase grows, Cursor may reference deleted files, folders, or functions. Reindexing helps prevent these issues. It is common for Cursor to "forget" when a function has been moved, leading to suggestions for fixes in the old files, which can create confusion.

6. **Work in increments.** Avoid requesting large feature drops. Use the `project.md` or ask Cursor, "What is the next feature to work on?" This approach helps maintain focus on the milestone order.
